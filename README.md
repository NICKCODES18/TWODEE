# 🎨 TwoDee Animation Generator

A desktop-based Python application that generates **2D animations from text prompts** using the **Turtle graphics** library.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project uses Python’s built-in Turtle module to draw and animate simple 2D graphics based on user prompts. It’s lightweight, interactive, and great for learning animation logic in Python.

---

## ✨ Features

🧠 **Text-to-Animation Generation**

* Converts natural language prompts into Turtle animations

🔺 **Shape Animations**

* Supports moving, transforming, and rotating shapes

🖥️ **Interface Options**

* CLI or Tkinter-based GUI

⚡ **Beginner-Friendly**

* Simple logic and minimal dependencies

## 🚀 Running the Application

Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

---

## 💡 Usage

1. Enter a text prompt (e.g., “Draw a square that rotates”).
2. The Turtle window will open and animate your command.

## 🧠 Example Prompts

* Draw a circle and move it to the right
* Show a bouncing square
* Animate a star drawing
* Display spiraling lines

## ⚙️ Customization

You can customize or extend animations by modifying:

* The **prompt parser** (to handle new commands)
* The **Turtle logic** inside `main.py`
